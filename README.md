# Packer
A simplistic packing app for android

My project for Los Altos Hacks 2016, this project was my first time building an android app from scratch.

I learned that swiping left and right are not native methods to android and need their own class of listener to use.

# Moving Forward
I'm looking to expand this app by allowing for procedural generation of the icons with either typed names or even importing images from the user's photo gallery. In addition, I want to be able to have a main menu in which the user could make different bags and manage them from there. Also looking for more and better stock graphics.
